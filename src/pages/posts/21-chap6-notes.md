**Deep Learning (2016)** 
* Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville
* GBC
* See also [Learning from Data](www.amlbook.com) book by **Abu-Mostafa, Magdon-Ismail, and Lin (aka AML)**. Relevant chapters: 
	* Chapter 2 (training set, test set, generalization, VC dimension, Bias vs. Variance; most relevant to GDB Chap 5) 
	* Chapter 3 (Linear Model-- most relevant to GDB Chapter 6)
	* Chapter 4 (Overfitting, Regularization, Weight Decay, and Validation Dataset)
## Chapter 6: Deep Feedforward Networks p. 163
* Basic definitions p.163-165: **depth** referring to number of hidden layers between input layer and output layer. **width** of each layer refers to how many dimensions can be managed. Each artificial neuron can be referred to as a **unit**.
* p.164 Rather than thinking of the layer as representing a single vector-to-vector function, we can also think of the layer as consisting of many units that act in parallel. Each unit can be thought of as a vector-to-scalar function; aka, multiple values for input to a neuron and a output a single activation value.
* **Important note about *asterisk* notation.** For a given function **g(x)**, the notation **g<sup>*</sup>(x)** indicates the optimal values of x such that dg/dx = g'(x) = 0. i
	* For example, when we engage in deep learning, we are trying to iteratively optimize the objective function **J(&#952;)** such that **J(&#952;)** gets as close as possible to **J<sup>*</sup>(&#952;)**. 
	* Aka **J(&#952;)** &#8776; **J<sup>*</sup>(&#952;)** 

### Extending linear models to represent nonlinear functions
* p.164 To extend linear models to represent nonlinear functions of x&#8407; , we can apply the linear model not to x&#8407; itself but instead to a transformed input phi &#966;(x&#8407;), where phi is a nonlinear transformation
* Equivalently, we can apply the kernel trick from Section 5.7.2. to obtain a nonlinear learning algorithm based on implicitly applying the phi &#966; mapping. 
* We can think of &#966; as providing a set of features describing x&#8407;, or as providing a new representation x&#8407;.  

### Three options of how to choose the mapping &#966;
* p. 165 Technically, the mapping phi &#966;: **X**&#8594;**Y**. Exactly equivalent to saying &#966;: &#8477;<sup>m</sup> &#8594; &#8477;<sup>n</sup>.
	* *Input* -- x&#8407; &#8712; domain **X** which is a real valued *m*-dimensional space aka &#8477;<sup>m</sup>. 
	* *Output* -- y&#8407; &#8712; co-domain **Y** which is a real valued *n*-dimensional space aka &#8477;<sup>n</sup>. 

1. **Option 1 -- Choose a very generic &#966;: X&#8594;Y.**
	* i.e., create a function phi &#966; that maps from an infinite-dimensional domain to a finite-dimensional co-domain, aka &#966;: &#8477;<sup>&#8734;</sup> &#8594; &#8477;<sup>n</sup>. 
	* This is implicitly what kernel machines do based on the RBF kernel (radial based function). See kernel machines on p. 139.
	* If &#966;(x&#8407;) is high-dimensional enough, it has enough model capacity to describe the data-generating process suggested by the training dataset. i.e., we will have done a good job minimizing training error.
	* However, if the capacity is too high, we will have overfitting problems. i.e., When we apply this model to new examples from the test dataset, it will have overlearned the training dataset and we will see generalization errors. The usual problems described from Section 5.2 (p.107).
1. **Option 2 -- Use symbolic AI approaches to painstakingly construct &#966;: X&#8594;Y.**
	* What GBC calls "Manually engineering &#966;()"
	* Before we invented deep learning, the hand-crafted approach was the most common strategy. Sounds like symbolic AI to me....
	* i.e., Manual engineering of &#966;(x&#8407;) required decades of human effort to learn each separate task.
	* Different hunan practitioners specialized in different domains such as speech recognition, computer vision, etc.
	* There was litte transfer between different domains.
1. **Option 3 -- Use deep learning to *learn* mapping &#966;** that is a composite of smaller successive functions f<sub>1</sub>()...f<sub>k</sub>()
	* *Chain rule* -- **&#966;(x&#8407;)** = y&#8407; = **f<sub>k</sub>(f<sub>...</sub>(f<sub>2</sub>(f<sub>1</sub>(x&#8407;))))** *aka* Jeff's repeated invocation of successive functions **f()**. That is, we can decompose the overall single-step function **&#966;()** into successive smaller functions **f<sub>1</sub>()...f<sub>k</sub>()**; one function f() for each hidden layer.

#### Diving more into Option 3 above
* p. 165 In the deep learning approach, we have a model y = f(x&#8407;; **&#952;**, w&#8407;).
	* In this context, theta **&#952;** refers to the set of parameters that are optimized over time to learn the proper construction of &#966;(). *JH: not 100% sure about this part*
		* **&#952;** is generally a vector that stores as many values as needed. *JH: not 100% sure about this part*
	* w&#8407; is another vector parameter that maps from &#966;(x&#8407;) to the ultimate output in **Y**. *JH: not 100% sure about this part*
* Of the 3 options outlined above on p.165, Option 3 Deep Learning is the only one that gives up the convexity of the training problem; however, the benefits outweight the costs.
* In this approach, we parametrize the representation as &#966;(x&#8407;;**&#952;**) and use the optimization algorithm to find the value for **&#952;** that best corresponds to a good representation.
* If we wish, this approach can capture the benefit of the first approach by being highly generic--we do so by using a very broad family of functions &#966;(x&#8407;;**&#952;**). 
* Deep learning can also capture the benefits of option 2 above (manual construction).
	* Human practitioners can encode their knowledge to help generalization by designing families &#966;(x&#8407;;**&#952;**) that they expect can perform well.
	* Using DL, now the human practioner can focus on finding the right *general family of functions* and then letting SDG etc find the ideal function (or ideal enough). 
	* Whereas in a pure version of Option 2, the human might have to manually find the perfect function which is a lot more time-consuming; indeed it may be effectively impossible b/c the search space is so large.

### Quick overview of the rest of Chapter 6
* Simple example of a feedforward network
* Address each of the design decisions needed to deploy a feedforward network
* Review the basics of gradient-based learning.
* Choice of activation function (logistic sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, softmax, etc.)
* Quick intro to backpropagation

### Example: Learning Exclusive OR (XOR)
* What is theta **&#952;** in this context? p. 167. "Now we must choose the form of our model, f(x&#8407;, **&#952;**). Suppose that we choose a linear model, theta **&#952;** consists of a vector w&#8407; and a single scalar bias b. Vector w&#8407; contains multiple weights.
* We can minimize objective function J(&#966;) in closed form with respect to w&#8407; and b using the normal equations. 
* Talks about Minsky's 1969 critique of learning XOR, and how it's solved by having at least 1 hidden layer. So now there is not a single function, but two functions f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub>.
* p.168 classic diagram of learning XOR Figure 6.1
* p.168 definition of **ReLU** aka **rectified linear unit**. Relevant papers were only published 2009-2011.
* p.169 Figure 6.3: Diagram of activation function 
	* The ReLU function is the default activation function recommended nowadays for most feedforward ANNs. Applying this function to the output of a linear transformation yields a nonlinear transformation. 
	* The function remains very close to linear, however, in the sense that it is a piecedwise linear function with 2 linear pieces. 
	* Because ReLUs are very nearly linear, they preserve many of the properties that make linear models easy to optimize with gradient-based methods.
	* They also preserve manhy of the properties that make linear models generalize well.
	* A common principle throughout computer science
* p.169 Figure 6.2: Two alternate ways of drawing an ANN diagram
	* The more verbose diagram on the right. In this style, every unit (*aka* neuron) is drawn as a distinct node in the graph. While this style is nicely unambigous and easier to read, it can require too much paper to represent more complex ANNs.
	* The more concise diagram on the left. In this style, we draw a circular node in the graph to represent the activation of an entire layer of neurons.
		* Sometimes we annotate the edges in this graph with the name of the parameters that describe the relationship between two layers.
		* Here, we use capital letter W to indicate that a matrix **W** contains the weight values between the input layer and the hidden layer. It's not just a scalar.
		* There is a vector w&#8407; that contains the activations between hidden layer and the final output layer.
		* We typically omit the intercept parameters associated with each layer when labeling this kind of drawing.
	* Note that the ANN expressed in Figure 6.2 solves the XOR problem. It has a total of 5 neurons--2 input neurons; 2 neurons in the hidden layer; and 1 output neuron.
* p.166-167. How do we solve XOR? 
	* Desired output for an XOR ann: Given 2 input neurons which only have 2 binary states (1 or 0), we want to learn a function that only outputs 1 when *exactly one* of the input neurons = 1. 
		* i.e., 0,0; 1,1 --> output=0
		* 1,0; 0,1 --> output=1
	* First let us demonstrate the naive implementation using linear regression and MSE (Mean Squared Error), which results in weights = 0 and b = 1/2. 
	* This means the output of the naive regression is always 1/2. We don't want that. In fact, Minsky proved in 1968 that a proper XOR functionality is impossible to train via neural networks; at least one that only has 2 layers..

* p.167 To solve this with a neural network, we need to have a *third*, hidden layer added. To write out equations and diagrams related to the XOR ANN, see Comp Sci notebook #1, November 21, 2023 drawings.
	* We have two functions that run sequentially. First f<sub>1</sub>(x&#8407;) outputs **h**. Then, f<sub>2</sub>(**h**) outputs y. 
	* *Formatting issue:* in above equestions, *h* should have a vector arrow drawn above it, but *h&#8407;* looks weird.

#### Using a simple feedforward network to solve XOR
* p. 167 A simple feedforward network is able to learn a different feature space in which a linear model is able to represent the solution.
* Specifically, we will introduce a simple FFN with one hidden layer containing 2 hidden units. See diagram drawn in JH Comp Science #1, 11/21/2023; p.169, Figure 6.2.
* This feedforward network has a vector of hidden units **h** that are computed by a function f<sub>1</sub>(x&#8407;; **`W`**,c&#8407;). Where **`W`** is a matrix containing the weights for both neurons h<sub>1</sub> and h<sub>2</sub>.
    * The output of function f<sub>1</sub> is then used for the 2nd, output layer.
    * The output layer is still just a linear regression model which is now applied to **h** rather than the inital input x&#8407;.
* Most ANNs use an affine transformation controlled by learned parameters, followed by a fixed nonlinear function called an activation function.
* We use that strategy here by defining **h** = g(**`W`**<sup>transpose</sup>x&#8407; + c&#8407;) where **`W`** is a matrix that provides the weights of a linear transformation and vector c&#8407; provides the biases.
* Previously, to describe a linear regression model, we used a vector of weights and a scalar bias parameter to describe an affine transformation from an input vector to an output scalar.
* Now, we describe an affine transformation from a vector x&#8407; to a vector **h**, so that an entire vector of bias parameters is needed.
* The activation function g is typically chosen to be a function that is applied element-wise, with each h<sub>i</sub> = g(x&#8407;<sup>transpose</sup>**`W`**<sub>i</sub>+c<sub>i</sub>).
* In modern ANNs, the default recommendation is to use the rectified Linear Unit **ReLU**.
* We can specify the complete network as f(x&#8407;;**`W`**,c&#8407;, w&#8407;, b) = w<sup>transpose</sup>max(

### Section 6.5: Overview of Backprop and other Differentiation Algorithms
#### 6.5.1: Introduction to Computational Graphs
#### 6.5.8: Complications (aka practical considerations) wrt simple theoretical narrative about backprop
#### 6.5.9: Differentiation outside the Deep Learning Community
* Relevant to unrolling RNNs in chapter 10
### Section 6.6: Historical Notes p. 220
* 'Feedforward networks can be seen as eﬃcient nonlinear function approximatorsbased on using gradient descent to minimize the error in a function approximation. From this point of view, the modern feedforward network is the culmination of centuries of progress on the general function approximation task.

#### Calculus in the 1600s, Cauchy approximations in the 1800s
* From Leibniz (1676) and L’Hôpital (1696), the calculus chain-rule that underlies backprop was invented in the 1600s. 
* 'Calculus and algebra have long been used to solve optimization in the closed form.' But gradient descent was not introduced as a technique for iteratively approximating the solution numerically (not analytically) until Cauchy (1847) and others in the mid-19th century.' p. 221
* 'Beginning in the 1940s, these function approximation techniques were used to motivate early machine learning models such as the perceptron. However, the earliest models were based on linear models.
* 'Critics including Marvin Minsky pointed outseveral of the ﬂaws of the linear model family, such as its inability to learn the XOR function, which led to a backlash against the entire neural network approach.
* 'Learning nonlinear functions required the development of the MLP (multilayer perceptron) plus the computing resources to compute a gradient through them.'
* 'Efficient applications of the chain rule based on dynamic programming began to appear in the 1960s and 1970s, mostly for control applications but also for sensitivity analysis.
* 'Werbos (1981) proposed applying these techniques to training ANN artificial neural networks.

#### Popularization of backpropagation in the 1980s
* Various people rediscovered and put into practice within silicon: Yann LeCun (1985), Parker (1985), the *Nature* article 'Learning representations by back-propogating errors' by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams (1986)
* 'Parallel Distributed Processing' by Rumelhart, McClelland, and the PDP Research Group (1986) was a critical book. In the chapter 'Learning internal representations by error propagation' by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams, the results of these early successes with backpropagation popularized these technique more broadly.
* The ideas put forward the PDP book, esp. those of Rumelhart and Hinton, go much beyond backprop. They include crucial ideas about the possible computational implementation ofseveral central aspects of cognition and learning, which came under the name *connectionism* because of the importance this school of thought places on theconnections between neurons as the locus of learning and memory.
* A key idea was the notion of **distributed representation** in an important chapter in the PDP book by Geoff Hinton and [Terry Sejnowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Sejnowski) (Princeton, Johns Hopkins, CalTech, Salk Institute). Co-invention of the Boltzmann machine, and his PhD advisor was John Hopfield of the ['Hopfield Network'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network). 'Learning and relearning in Boltzmann machines', from Vol 1., Chapter 7 p. 282-317 of *Parallel Distributed Processing*
* Following the success and popularity of the backprop algorithm in the mid-1980s, neural network research gained momentum and reached a peak of AI spring in the early 1990s. 
* 'Afterwards, the AI winter returned for neural networks and other machine learning techniques became more popular until the modern deep learning renaissance that began in 2006 with deep belief networks.'
* GBC: 'The core ideas behind modern feedforward networks have not changed substantially since the 1980s. p.221
	* The **same** back-propagation algorithm and the **same approaches to gradient descent** are still in use. 
	* Most of the improvement in neural network performance from 1986 to 2015 can be attributed to two factors. 
		1. First, larger datasets have reduced the degree to which statistical generalization is achallenge for neural networks.
		1. Second, neural networks have become much larger, because of more powerful computers and better software infrastructure.

#### 1990s–late 2000s Algorithmic Improvements: (a) Cross-Entropy Loss and (b) ReLUs
*A small number of algorithmic changes have also improved the performance of neural networks noticeably. p.222*

##### (a) Rise of Cross-Entropy Loss
* 'One of these algorithmic changes was the replacement of mean squared error with the **cross-entropy family of loss functions**.
	* Mean squared error was popular in the 1980s and 1990s but was gradually **replaced by cross-entropy losses** and the **principle of maximum likelihood** as ideas spread between the statistics communityand the machine learning community. 
	* The use of cross-entropy losses greatly improved the performance of models with sigmoid and softmax outputs, which had previously suﬀered from saturation and slow learning when using the mean squared error loss.

##### (b) Rise of Rectified Linear Units
* 'The other major algorithmic change that has greatly improved the performance of feedforward networks was the replacement of sigmoid hidden units with piecewise linear hidden units, such as rectiﬁed linear units. 
* JH: Before the rise of ReLU, *sigmoid functions* were used for the neurons in the hidden layers. For example, logistic / sigmoid activation functions.
* 'Rectiﬁcation using the `max{0,z}` function was introduced in early neural network models and dates back at least as far as the cognitron and neocognitron (Fukushima, 1975, 1980). 
* 'These early models [from the 1970s] did *not* use rectiﬁed linear units but instead applied rectiﬁcation to *nonlinear functions*.
* 'Despite the early popularity of rectiﬁcation, it was largely replaced by sigmoidsin the 1980s, perhaps because sigmoids perform better when neural networks are very small. 
* 'As of the early 2000s, rectiﬁed linear units were avoided because of a somewhat superstitious belief that activation functions with nondiﬀerentiable points must be avoided. 
* 'This began to change in about 2009. Jarrett et al. (2009) observed that “using a rectifying nonlinearity is the single most important factor in improving the performance of a recognition system,” among several diﬀerent factors of neural network architecture design.'
* 'For small datasets, Jarrett et al. (2009) observed that using rectifying non-linearities is even more important than learning the weights of the hidden layers.
* 'Random weights are suﬃcient to propagate useful information through a rectiﬁed linear network, enabling the classiﬁer layer at the top to learn how to map diﬀerent feature vectors to class identities.'
* 'When more data is available, learning begins to extract enough useful knowledgeto exceed the performance of randomly chosen parameters. Glorot et al. (2011a) showed that learning is far easier in deep rectiﬁed linear networks than in deepnetworks that have curvature or two-sided saturation in their activation functions.'
* 'Rectiﬁed linear units are also of historical interest because they show thatneuroscience has continued to have an inﬂuence on the development of deeplearning algorithms. Glorot et al. (2011a) motivated rectiﬁed linear units from biological considerations.
* The half-rectifying nonlinearity was intended to capture these properties of biological neurons: (1) For some inputs, biological neurons are completely inactive. (2) For some inputs, a biological neuron’s output is proportional to its input. (3) Most of the time, biological neurons operate in the regime where they are inactive (i.e., they should have sparse activations).

#### From 2006 onwards starting with Deep Belief Networks
* 'When the modern resurgence of deep learning began in 2006, feedforward networks continued to have a bad reputation. From about 2006 to 2012, it was widely believed that feedforward networks would not perform well unless they were assisted by other models, such as probabilistic models. 
* 'It is now known that with the right resources and engineering practices, feedforward networks perform very well. Today, gradient-based learning in feedforward networks is used as a tool to develop probabilistic models, such as the variational autoencoderand generative adversarial networks, described in Chapter 20. 
* 'Rather than being viewed as an unreliable technology that must be supported by other techniques, gradient-based learning in feedforward networks has been viewed since 2012 as a powerful technology that can be applied to many other machine learning tasks. 
* 'In 2006, the community used unsupervised learning to support supervised learning, and now, ironically, it is more common to use supervised learning to support unsupervised learning. Feedforward networks continue to have unfulﬁlled potential. 
* 'In the future, we expect they will be applied to many more tasks, and that advances in optimization algorithms and model design will improve their performance even further. This chapter has primarily described the neural network family of models. In the subsequent chapters, we turn to how to use these models--how to regularize and train.'
